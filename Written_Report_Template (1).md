# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. The ultimate purpose of the Outcomes Based on Launch date chart was to analyze the outcomes of theater campaigns fare based on the month of the year. Alternatively, the purpose of the Outcomes Based on Goals chart was to visualize and analyze the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal dollar-amount ranges.
